# OdinProject01_Recipes
Project 1 from Odin Project (foundations of HTML) - Basic web page displaying recipes

This project is meant to be a back to basics for me. While HTML is fairly straightforward and simple, experience even with boilerplate and basic tools is important when reviewing old knowledge.

Primarily this project is meant to illustrate basic paragraphs, links, images, lists, etc in regards to html. No css or styling was needed, so none was provided.

I chose a subject I enjoyed working with: Legend of Zelda, breath of the wild recipes.

The project was fun and fairly straightforward, taking approximately 4 hours to complete due mainly to gathering images and recipes.
